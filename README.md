#### Problem Statement: 

Currently in this environment it is expected that there will be shortages of essential supplies in sectors which are getting strained(hospitals, supply chain etc). 

#### Solution: 

We need to build a not for profit and scalable service that will allow us to connect Essential Entities(need a better name) with Suppliers. Also, build a Volunteer network to get those supplies to  Essential Entities(figure out logistics etc over phone)

#### Stage 1 

**Build Website(ThinkForLiving.Com) - MVP - Flutter(Tina, <your name here>)**

The solution at stage 1 is limited to Australia only(we would like to test it and proceed in a meaningful way)

For MVP it's quite simple:
Essential Entities - Register using site(simple form is enough) and specify what you need(protective gear, food, space etc)
Service Providers/Suppliers/Vendors - Register using site and specify your service type(example - have 100,000 nos protective gear, food, space - at cos)
Volunteers/Enablers - Match Essential Entities with Service Providers and figure out a way to ensure that request is fulfilled transparently(volunteer fee?)

**Develop Content(need a owner - place names here)**

TODO: Find a good name to represent  - Essential Entities,  Service Providers/Suppliers/Vendors, Volunteers/Enablers

Essential Entities - The content should be able to convince everyone to use our portal and to request services.\ 
Service Providers/Suppliers/Vendors -  The content should be able to convince providers  to join our cause and help with service 
Volunteers/Enablers - The content should be able to convince volunteers to join us (need to consider volunteer support here)


**Example Site(for MVP): https://www.helpyourpeers.com - this was built using squarespace**
